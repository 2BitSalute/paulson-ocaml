Code and exercises based on Lawrence C. Paulson's wonderfully readable [***ML for the Working Programmer***](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lp15/MLbook/).

The original code is in ML, but it translates remarkably easily to OCaml, making the book as useful as [Real World OCaml](https://dev.realworldocaml.org/). Both are eminently readable and well-organized, with the main difference being the emphasis on the libraries and tools in RWO vs. the emphasis on proofs in MLWP.

The code needs to be organized far better into chapters and sections, but I'm simply anxious to get through the book to the most interesting (to me) parts, such as the module system in Chapter 7 and the parser implementation in Chapter 9.
